ED & Labor Unit

This GitHub repository supports a RAND Commentary written by Jhacova Williams and can be found at the following URL:  https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/09/laid-off-more-hired-less-black-workers-in-the-covid.html

#### -- Project Status: Completed.

## Project description
This code supports a commentary that measures the labor force status of black and white workers using CPS data from March 2020 to August 2020.

### Methods used
* Descriptive statistics

### Technologies
* Stata

## Getting started

1. Download the three Do files in this repository.

2. Download data from the cps.ipums.org (see “Analysis” do file for list of variables). When selecting subsamples in IPUMS, be sure to de-select ASEC samples. These are automatically filled in when creating a new IPUMS extract, so be sure to remove these from your selected subsamples.
    
3. Run “Analysis – Black Workers during COVID.do” to generate the statistics referenced in the commentary.

### Other notes

The definitions for employment states used in this commentary (i.e., employed, temporary layoff, permanent layoff, and not in the labor force) were developed for an earlier commentary by Kathryn Edwards (the link to that original commentary and the associated GitHub repository can be found in the reference section below).

The data for figure 2 (Unemployment rate by race during the pandemic) comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Situation Summary. Specifically, the data are from Table A-2 (Employment status of the civilian population by race, sex, and age). To access this data, please go to the following URL: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm and click the link at the bottom for “Table A-2” Employment status of the civilian population by race, sex, and age”.
